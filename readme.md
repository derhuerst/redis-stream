## Usage with JavaScript

### Writing to a Redis Stream

```js
const {createClient} = require('redis')
const createWriter = require('@derhuerst/redis-stream/writer')

const redis = createClient()
const writer = createWriter(redis, 'some-stream-name')
writer.once('finish', () => redis.quit())
writer.on('error', console.error)

writer.write({foo: 'bar'})
writer.end({hey: 'there!'})
```

### Reading from a Redis Stream

```js
const {createClient} = require('redis')
const createReader = require('@derhuerst/redis-stream/reader')

const redis = createClient()
const reader = createReader(redis, 'some-stream-name')
reader.on('data', console.log)
reader.on('error', console.error)
```


## API

### `createWriter(redis, streamName)`

Returns a [readable stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_writable_streams) in [object mode](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode).

### `createReader(redis, streamName, opt = {})`

Returns a [readable stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) in [object mode](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode). `opt` may be an object with the following entries:

- `live`: Wait for newly added items? Default: `true`
- `waitTimeout`: How long to wait for newly added items. Default: `Infinity`
- `history`: Read all past items from the stream? Default: `false`
